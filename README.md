The key is to do this FIRST thing in the morning routinely and whether you feel like it or not! DO NOT be distracted by anything: any thoughts or feelings within,
or any persons around you. Modify this as you like; print the document and write new prayers on the back of this sheet. 

Include your daily Bible reading at the end if you have time. 

If you donâ€™t have time in the morning, read your Bible consecutively before going to bed at night
